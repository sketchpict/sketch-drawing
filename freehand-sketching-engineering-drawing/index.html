<p>Freehand Sketching, âsketchingâ generally means freehand drawing. Line conventions in engineering drawing. A drawing can be done using freehand, instruments. To foster creative problem solving, engineering schools should offer formal courses in sketching and drawing in support of design projects: It is also a technique used by an architect or designer to try different ideas and establish a composition before.</p>
