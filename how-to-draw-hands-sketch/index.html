<p>Draw a bent box for the central part of the hand, draw in the cushions of the palm if they are visible at this angle. Once the few overall lines feel integrated and related to each other, you will have done much to ensure a successful outcome to your drawing.

Fists, palms, intertwined fingers, the victory pose (fingers in a v shape), baby hands, and resting hands with slightly curled fingers are all important hand sketches to try out if you want to perfect the hand drawing technique. So just draw the hand from different angles and experience its different shapes. Do not worry about similarities and proportions.</p>
