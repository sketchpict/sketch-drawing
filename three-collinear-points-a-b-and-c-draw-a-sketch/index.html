<p>Let a,b,c are three vectors of which every pair is non, Use dashed lines to show where one plane is hidden. We can draw a line through a and b, a and c, and b and c but not a single line through all 3 points. 6.) name a pair of opposite rays. If you have the coordinates of the points, map them on a coordinate plane. P, g, and n.</p>
