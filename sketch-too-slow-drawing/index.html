<p><strong>Sketch Too Slow Drawing</strong>, Sketchup runs great for the most part, but its getting to the point where layout is unusable due to its slow speed and response time. If this is too small, too large, or uneven, the material can be cracked during drawing. If you are finding your file being very slow to navigate, slagging on the screen as you move the mouse, and very slow at loading, that is likely because your file is too big.</p>

<p>How do i make it faster? While a performance improvement at this zoom level, it becomes very difficult to design well or with pixel perfection (too many compromises for a primary tool). Even when performing simple commands like opening the options dialog box, selecting faces, or editing dimensions we would see an abnormal delay. If you are finding your file being very slow to navigate, slagging on the screen as you move the mouse, and very slow at loading, that is likely because your file is too big. It is fast and the quality is excellent. The program has become so slow it’s impossible to get anything done in a timely manor.</p>

But now layout is ridiculously slow. However, the drawing file that i have created from the assembly could not be running any slower. This appears to cause it to lag severely.
