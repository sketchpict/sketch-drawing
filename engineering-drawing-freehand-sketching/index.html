<p>This is especially true for the engineer. Sketching has been part of design project work in many places, and various measures have been taken to support the development of the necessary skills in a formal way (this was the origin of the ucl drawing gym), but nothing has been found that addresses the specific skills of rapid sketching as communication for engineering designers. American society for engineeri ng education (asee), freehand sketch engineering objects is the second more importan t skill for graphical commun ication to. It is used for daily communication in the engineering world as drawing is the international language of engineering. Projection theory provides the instructional framework, and freehand sketching the means for learning the important graphical concepts at the core of this work. We will treat sketching and drawing as one.</p>
